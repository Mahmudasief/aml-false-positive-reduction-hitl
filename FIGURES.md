# Figures and Visualizations

This repository follows a text-first reporting strategy.

All primary empirical findings are reported directly in:
- `RESULTS.md`
- `RESULTS_NUMBERS.md`

Figures such as cost curves, regime diagrams, and threshold trade-off
plots are generated from the notebooks in `notebooks/` and are not
committed by default.

This design choice avoids storing derived artifacts and keeps the
repository focused on decision-policy analysis rather than presentation
assets.

The `figures/` directory is reserved for optional generated outputs if
needed for paper submission or presentation.
